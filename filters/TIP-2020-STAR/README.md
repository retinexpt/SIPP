# STAR
 I will organize the code when I am not busy.
 
 Sorry for the delay.



The code in this package implements the proposed Retinex method as described in the following paper:

```
@article{STAR2020,        
         author = {Jun Xu and Yingkun Hou and Dongwei Ren and Li Liu and Fan Zhu and Mengyang Yu and Haoqian Wang and Ling Shao},     
         title = {STAR: A Structure and Texture Aware Retinex Model},      
         journal = {IEEE Transactions on Image Processing},            
         year={2020},          
         volume={29},       
         number={1},       
         pages={5022--5037},      
         doi={10.1109/TIP.2020.2974060},      
}
```
